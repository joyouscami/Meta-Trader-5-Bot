🤖 MetaTrader 5 Trading Bot – Predictive Analysis with Historical Data

This project is a work-in-progress where I am building a Python-based trading bot that connects to MetaTrader 5 (MT5), leverages historical market data, and applies data science techniques to predict trade opportunities. The aim is to combine algorithmic trading strategies with data-driven forecasting for improved decision-making in financial markets.

🔍 Project Overview

Financial markets generate massive streams of time series data. Traders often rely on intuition or static rules, but this project explores how machine learning and statistical analysis can augment trading decisions.

The project involves:

- Connecting to MetaTrader 5 and retrieving historical data (candlesticks, OHLCV)

- Preprocessing and cleaning raw financial time series

- Engineering features such as moving averages, RSI, and volatility measures

- Building predictive models to forecast short-term price movements

- Designing a framework for backtesting and evaluating strategies

- Deploying a trading bot capable of executing trades based on predictions

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python – core development

- MetaTrader 5 (MT5) API – market data & trade execution

- pandas, numpy – data manipulation

- matplotlib, seaborn – visualization

- scikit-learn – machine learning models (in progress)

- statsmodels – time series analysis (planned)

🚧 Current Progress

✅ Connected to MetaTrader 5 and retrieved historical OHLCV data

✅ Performed initial exploratory analysis on trends, volatility, and patterns

🔄 Building feature engineering pipeline (moving averages, RSI, etc.)

🔄 Experimenting with baseline predictive models

⏳ Next step: integrate predictions into a backtesting framework

📈Insights (so far)

- Market volatility clusters are visible in historical data, suggesting modeling opportunities

- Moving averages show strong potential for trend-following strategies

- Preliminary exploration indicates certain patterns before high-volume moves

🌟 Why This Project Matters

- Algorithmic trading is where finance meets data science. This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Work with real-world financial APIs

- Apply time series analysis and machine learning to market data

- Engineer features relevant to trading strategies

- Design a system that moves from exploration → modeling → automation

🚀 Future Work

- Implement and evaluate ML models (logistic regression, random forests, LSTMs)

- Backtest strategies against historical data for performance validation

- Automate trading execution within MT5

- Extend to risk management strategies (stop loss, take profit, position sizing)
